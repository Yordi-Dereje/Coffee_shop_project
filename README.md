# Coffee shop project
This simple project features single linked list, double linked list and queue (implemented with a linked list). It is supposed to mimic the workings of a coffee shop that accepts customers' orders and assigns them a place in a queue.
It is done with the c++ language and is cli based. All function prototypes and structures for the linked lists are listed on the header file of the same name.
